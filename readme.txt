Drum Kit Project
This is a simple drum kit project made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When you press specific keys on the keyboard or click using the mouse, a drum sound is triggered. The keys used for triggering different drum sounds are W, A, S, D, J, K, and L. Each key corresponds to a different drum sound.

Features:
Press the following keys to play different drum sounds:
W: Drum sound 1
A: Drum sound 2
S: Drum sound 3
D: Drum sound 4
J: Drum sound 5
K: Drum sound 6
L: Drum sound 7
Click on the drum images with your mouse to trigger the sounds.
If you press an invalid key, an alert will appear saying, "Wrong key pressed".
Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Download all the drum sounds from here and place them in the appropriate folder.

Ensure that you update the paths of the sound files in the JavaScript and CSS files according to your file structure.

Open the index.html file in your browser to see the drum kit in action.

Files Included:
index.html: The main HTML structure of the drum kit.
style.css: CSS styling for the drum kit interface.
script.js: JavaScript to handle the keyboard and mouse events and play the sounds.
sound files: Audio files for each drum sound (ensure you update the paths).
How it Works:
The JavaScript listens for key presses or mouse clicks.
When the corresponding key or image is clicked, it plays the associated drum sound.
If a wrong key is pressed, an alert message is triggered to notify the user.
To Do:
Add more drum sounds or keys for more variety.
Improve UI/UX for better accessibility and interaction.
